# Civic Connect: Bridging Citizens and City Services with AI

**Civic Connect** is an innovative, serverless web application designed to empower citizens by providing a direct line to their local government. Users can report, track, and view resolutions for civic issues in their neighborhood, fostering transparency and community engagement. The platform features a public dashboard, a comprehensive admin panel for city officials, and is supercharged with the Google Gemini API for intelligent features like department suggestions, issue summaries, and a helpful chatbot.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Architecture

This project is a modern, **serverless, client-side application** built with React, demonstrating the power of browser-based technologies for rapid, feature-rich prototyping.

-   **Frontend:** **React** & **TypeScript**
-   **Styling:** **Tailwind CSS**
-   **AI Integration:** **Google Gemini API** for all intelligent features.
-   **Data Persistence:** The application cleverly utilizes the browser's **`localStorage`** to simulate a backend and database. This approach enables full data persistence (users, issues, notifications) within the user's browser, making the application self-contained, easy to deploy, and perfect for a hackathon environment where speed and innovation are key.

## 🚀 Run Locally

This contains everything you need to run your app locally.

**Prerequisites:** Node.js

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set your Gemini API Key:**
    Create a file named `.env.local` in the root of the project and add your API key:
    ```
    GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
    ```

4.  **Run the app:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
The application will be running on `http://localhost:5173`.

## 🔮 Future Scope

While `localStorage` is excellent for this prototype, a production-scale version would be architected with a dedicated backend and database.

-   **Backend:** Migrate to a robust backend framework like **Node.js + Express** or a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) like **Firebase/Supabase**.
-   **Database:** Implement a scalable database like **PostgreSQL** or a real-time NoSQL database like **Firebase Firestore**.
-   **Real-time Updates:** Use WebSockets or services like Firestore to push live data updates to all connected clients simultaneously.
-   **Cloud Storage:** Move image uploads from base64 strings in `localStorage` to a dedicated service like **Google Cloud Storage** or **AWS S3**.
